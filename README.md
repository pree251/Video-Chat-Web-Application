# Video-Chat-Web-Application
The main objective of this project is to build a Real-Time Video Chat Web Application using WebRTC, which will allow us to establish peer-to-peer connection between 2 or more browsers. This application should enable a chat/messaging option to the user and the user should also be able to stream his/her video and see the video streamed by the other users. Apart from the video streaming feature, the user should also be able to mute/unmute and turn on/turn off his/her video. To add more functionalities to the application, the option of changing the way the userâ€™s video appears, i.e., the addition of filters/effects should be implemented in the application. Screen-sharing and screen-recording features are also available. 

**Technologies Used**

1.	Embedded JavaScript - EJS is used for integrating Frontend and Backend. It is basically a template engine used by Node JS to create HTML template with minimal code.

2.	Nodejs/Express - It is used for server framework. Express will be the backbone of our application. Express is one of the most popular web application frameworks for Node.js.

3.	Simple-Peer (WebRTC) - Captures and optionally streams audio and/or video. This will be incorporated by the PeerJS library. 

4.	Socket.io - It enables real-time, bidirectional communication between web clients and servers. 

5.	CSS - CSS is used to add style to a webpage by dictating how a site is displayed on a browser.


**We have deployed our Real-Time Video Chat Web Application on Heroku App. The Heroku App link which is generated during the deployment can be used by other users to join the server on which the WebRTC has been deployed.**
